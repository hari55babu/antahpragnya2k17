Thrust is the water rocket event where you have the chance to show case your rocketry skills and your practical talent.<br>
Experience the fun in true engineering while working with rocket propulsion and aerodynamics. One of the most fun events, it will surelyleave you missing it once it's over. <br>
The purpose here is to design and manufacture a water rocket. A water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass.<br> Thepressure vessel - the engine of the rocket - is usually a used plastic soft drink bottle. The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. It is an example of Newton's third law of motion.<br>
It covers various aspects of product making including design, model construction.

<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT :</strong><br>
Design and construct a water propelled rocket pressurized with air to compete against different
constraints in separate rounds.<br>
<b>ROUND 1:</b><br>
i.  The objective of the preliminary round is to launch a water-rocket without any payload, and make it go as far as possible from the launch point i.e. themaximum horizontal distance.<br>
ii. The horizontal distance will be considered from the starting point to the point where any part of the rocket first touches the ground.<br>
iii.Multi-stage rockets are also allowed but the combined tank capacity must be 2 liters only.<br>
iv. Each team shall be allowed two chances to launch and the better of the two will be considered (This may be altered later based on the performance of most teams.)<br>
<b>ROUND 2:</b><br>
i.  Round Two tests the accuracy of your rockets.<br>
ii. Each team will be having two chances. The maximum score that a team can earn is 10 points in each round that can be scored by hitting the rocketon a particular point (ex-80meter with some angle say 60 degrees) in 2nd round. The points will be deducted as
much is the deviation from the point. The better of two chances will be taken into consideration.
<br><b>ROUND 3:</b><br>
i.  In this round the teams whose rocket will remain in air for maximum time will get maximum
point. The participants can even launch their rocket according to them.

    Rules & Regulations
  </div>
  <div class="content">
i.  A team may consist of a maximum of 3 members.<br>
ii. Teams may use different rockets for different rounds.<br>
iii.Cross branch teams are also allowed.<br>
iv. The rocket must be built completely from scratch and not using model rocketry part.<br>
v.  The pressure vessel must be made from commercially available nonmetallic soda bottles (PET bottles). Fins if required are to beconstructed from lightweight non-metallic materials.<br>
vi. The rocket must use tap water as its primary reaction mass. Thrust must come from expelling reaction mass/water, not from air discharge.<br>
vii.Participants will be provided with tap water.<br>
viii.The angle at which the rocket is to be launched can be decided by the participant.The rocket must use compressed air as its energy source. A normal bicycle pump as well as a foot pump will be provided to compress the air. The size of the pump outlet will be the standard type available in the market. If your design has a different nozzle size, please be sure to bring your own nozzle and connecting pipe.<br>
ix.  All parts of the rockets should be properly attached to the main body. If any part (fins etc.) breaks away during flight, it will compromise thesafety of the spectators. Therefore, such water rockets may be disqualified from further participation at the discretion of the organizers.<br>
x.Each team is strongly advised to bring two rockets of the same design (the second acting as a backup) in case of any damage .The organizerswill not be responsible for damage suffered by rockets during the competition. Extra time shall not be given for remaking of
damaged rockets.<p>

1.The final judgments is based on the total points scored by the participated team in all the three rounds described above.<br>
2.The points are also given to the teams based on their creativity and simplicity inmaking the water propelled rockets, this will be decided at the time of the event by the event manager by viewing their rocket samples.<br>
3.The total points scored in all the three rounds are added up and awarded astheir final score.<br>

<strong>Problem statement:</strong><br>
Build a hovercraft (wireless air cushioned vehicle) which travels on various terrains like sand, mud, water and concrete and complete the specified track in the least possible time.<br>

<strong>Round 1</strong><br>
This will be a knock out round, teams have to complete the specified track successfully. Teams that clears the knockout stage will move to the next round.<br>
<strong>Round 2</strong><br>
In this round the qualified teams have to attend one more test where a hovercraft should reach the destination specified without deviating from the path and also without any break in the least amount of time.
